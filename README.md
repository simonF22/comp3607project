1. The address of the zipped folder containing all zipped submissions must be entered when prompted to. Example: C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\submissions.zip
2. The files will then be extracted to a folder called extractedSubmissions in the working directory, from there the JAVA classes can be accessed.
IMPORTANT: Due to a bug with not detecting the classpaths at runtime, you MUST run the app and AGAIN enter the address of the zipped folder without deleting extractedSubmissions from the working directory.
3. After classes are evaluated, a PDF report will be generated and placed in the respective student submission folder.
